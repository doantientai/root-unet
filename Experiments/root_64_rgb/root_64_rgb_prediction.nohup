Using Theano backend.
WARNING (theano.sandbox.cuda): The cuda backend is deprecated and will be removed in the next release (v0.10).  Please switch to the gpuarray backend. You can get more information about how to switch at this URL:

the side H is not compatible with the selected stride of 20
img_h 1661, patch_h 64, stride_h 20
(img_h - patch_h) MOD stride_h: 17
So the H dim will be padded with additional 3 pixels
the side W is not compatible with the selected stride of 20
img_w 2325, patch_w 64, stride_w 20
(img_w - patch_w) MOD stride_w: 1
So the W dim will be padded with additional 19 pixels
